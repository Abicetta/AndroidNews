# AndroidNews

This is an exercise for Udacity Android Basics Nanodegree. The goal is to create a News Feed app which gives a user regularly-updated news from the internet related to a particular topic, person, or location.
The app contains a main which displays multiple news stories about android.
The stories shown on the main screen update properly whenever new news data is fetched from the API by https://open-platform.theguardian.com/documentation/

The main screen with the list of news. I made the tecnology section green colored, the other sections blue.
